# Plot data on a map

This project demonstrates how to plot data on a map using geographic data. The Indian map used here is sourced from [gist.github.com/curran](https://gist.github.com/curran/49fa25fc44c84fcbebb51e60946145a4). It contains JSON geometry data for each district in India, represented by latitude and longitude coordinates.

In this project, **geopandas** is the primary library for handling geospatial data. It extends the functionality of pandas and allows for the easy handling of shapefiles, GeoJSON, and other geospatial file formats.

#### Packages used for plotting
- geopandas
- matplotlib
- pandas
- numpy

#### Other packages
- random
- json
- seaborn
